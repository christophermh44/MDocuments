MDocuments
==========

Markdown Documents Explorer

1. Upload some markdown documents into md folder
2. Eventually, add some css by naming your css with the same name as the markdown document. For example: example.md and example.css
3. Explore your documents in the application… enjoy!

Many views are provided with the application, but you can add your own view inside the tpl folder.

This project uses :
- Markdown (for the document writing syntax)
- Dompdf (to generate awesome PDF)
- Zepto (jQuery is too heavy…)
- Remark (to generate beautiful slides)
- The free font Oxygen is included inside Dompdf

TODO :
- Remove apparently useless html2pdf library
- Improve source quality
- Any ideas are welcomed !
